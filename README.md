# Machine Learning Trading Bot - Optional

![Decorative image.](Images/15-2-Homework.png)

In this Challenge, I have assumed the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. My firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, my firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave my firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. I am planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firmâ€™s competitive advantage in the market. I will enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

### I have created the following 

* Implemented an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions.

* Adjusted the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm.

* Trained a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model.


### Summary of findings

#### Establish a baseline performance and tune the baseline algorithm 

* Save a PNG image of the cumulative return plot that shows the actual returns vs. the strategy returns. (8 points)
* Slice the training dataset into different time periods in order to tune the model by adjusting the dataset size. (8 points)
* Change one of both window sizes in order to tune the model by adjusting the SMA input features. (8 points)
* Save a PNG image of the cumulative product of the actual returns vs. the strategy returns. (8 points)

#### Evaluate a new machine learning classifier 

##### To receive all points, your code must:

* Import a new classifier. (9 points)
* Fit the new classifier using the original training data. (9 points)
* Backtest the new model. (11 points)
* Save a PNG image of the cumulative product of actual returns vs/ strategy returns. (9 points)
